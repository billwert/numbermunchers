# AI Coding Instructions

This project uses **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** as the comprehensive documentation for AI coding agents.

Please refer to that file for:
- Project architecture and patterns
- Development workflows
- Game mechanics and components
- Common gotchas and solutions
- File organization

The same instructions work for both GitHub Copilot and Claude Code.
